# No-bro camp desired outcome

The main outcome of our journey is the learning gathered during this course. Its structure assumes that there is a set of key takeaways in each module that can be leveraged further.

We're going to build a web applicaiton during this course. The aim is to have a hands-on experience of working on a real project to utilize skills acquired during No-bro camp. We will put a strong emphasis also on making pragmatic decisions during the project. We want to build something nice that you can use in your daily life. We won't be doing any of rocket science yet. We'll be focusing on strengthening fundamental skills of a modern web developer.
