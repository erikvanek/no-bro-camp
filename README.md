# No bro camp!
This project aims to help people to acquire knowledge needed to be able to apply for modern web development roles. Unlike 'your general web dev bootcamp' the aim is to bring more T-shape-like content. That means that the focus of this set of resources is not only on technical / coding skills. We try to also to bring more product / process oriented topics so that people that go through this 'bootcamp' do not face as steep learning curve when they join teams they want.

## Why no bro?
[This article](https://medium.com/swlh/bro-culture-and-other-signs-your-company-is-atoxic-work-place-7aff0e06394b) does a great job in explaining the main idea. It is not easy to create a fully inclusive and diverse teams. Especially in tech. Sadly.
I am not an expert on that but what I often see are pretty homogenous teams. This deserves some challenge since I believe the biggest innovation and good idea come from diverse teams. Having different backgrounds and mindsets is a good ingredient to have truly creative teams. The aim of this project is to bring tech education to those that are interested and did not have a chance to get this sort of education before.

## Structure
Course is divided into three main branches - coding, tooling & process & finally - sample project. Let's decribe them a bit more thoroughly below.

### Coding
This is the 'hard' part of this bootcamp and it's a basic building block we can't really avoid. Vast majority of time spent on building digical products should ideally be quality focus time dedicated to the craft of coding. Since Javascript became _lingua franca_ of web development we're going to use it during this course. The main aim is to give participants a hands-on experience with creating modern web application and sites. We try to adhere to contemporary web standars.

### Tooling & process
There has been quite some change in software team workflos in recent years and Git played significant role in this transformation. Collaborative work has never been easier before. One just needs to understand relevant mindsets and mental models and once it _clicks_ you don't want to go back :). Gone are the days of tedious 'works on my machine' excused. Modern tooling centered around continous integration and continous delivery make reasoning about what is being developed smoother and way less confusing.

### Sample project
So we have some technical knowledge and we know how to efficiently collaborate. The only missing part is to apply it on the project. Before we start the bootcamp we align on some decently sized project that we're use to showcase gathered knowledge during its duration. Apart from using our technical knowlwege, the aim here is to make pragmatic decisions, move fast, possibly fail fast and learn as much as possible. Human-centered design or agile software development methods are our big friends here and we try to adhere to them where it makes sense. They are no silver bullets, but good points where to start.


## Why all this?
Let's try to challenge the 'tech only' bootcamps here a bit. Usually those 'non-tech' parts are way more important than the hard skills that are can be learnt if needed. The main aim is to bring more 'all-around' knowlege to the world of people aspiring towards tech industry. ... :)
