      This project aims to help people to acquire knowledge needed to be able to
      apply for modern web development roles. Unlike 'your general web dev
      bootcamp' the aim is to bring more T-shape-like content. That means that
      the focus of this set of resources is not only on technical / coding
      skills. We try to also to bring more product / process oriented topics so
      that people that go through this 'bootcamp' do not face as steep learning
      curve when they join teams they want.

    <h2>Why no bro?</h2>

      does a great job in explaining the main idea. It is not easy to create a
      fully inclusive and diverse teams. Especially in tech. Sadly. I am not an
      expert on that but what I often see are pretty homogenous teams. This
      deserves some challenge since I believe the biggest innovation and good
      idea come from diverse teams. Having different backgrounds and mindsets is
      a good ingredient to have truly creative teams. The aim of this project is
      to bring tech education to those that are interested and did not have a
      chance to get this sort of education before.
    </p>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Course is divided into three main branches - coding, tooling & process &
      finally - sample project. Let's decribe them a bit more thoroughly below.
    </p>

    <h3>Coding</h3>
    <p>
      This is the 'hard' part of this bootcamp and it's a basic building block
      we can't really avoid. Vast majority of time spent on building digical
      products should ideally be quality focus time dedicated to the craft of
      coding. Since Javascript became _lingua franca_ of web development we're
      going to use it during this course. The main aim is to give participants a
      hands-on experience with creating modern web application and sites. We try
      to adhere to contemporary web standars.
    </p>
    <h3>Tooling & process</h3>
    <p>
      There has been quite some change in software team workflos in recent years
      and Git played significant role in this transformation. Collaborative work
      has never been easier before. One just needs to understand relevant
      mindsets and mental models and once it _clicks_ you don't want to go back
      :). Gone are the days of tedious 'works on my machine' excused. Modern
      tooling centered around continous integration and continous delivery make
      reasoning about what is being developed smoother and way less confusing.
    </p>
    <h3>Sample project</h3>
    <p>
      So we have some technical knowledge and we know how to efficiently
      collaborate. The only missing part is to apply it on the project. Before
      we start the bootcamp we align on some decently sized project that we're
      use to showcase gathered knowledge during its duration. Apart from using
      our technical knowlwege, the aim here is to make pragmatic decisions, move
      fast, possibly fail fast and learn as much as possible. Human-centered
      design or <a href="/process-to-product">agile software development</a> methods are our big friends here and
      we try to adhere to them where it makes sense. They are no silver bullets,
      but good points where to start.
    </p>

    <h2>Why all this?</h2>
    <p>
      Let's try to challenge the 'tech only' bootcamps here a bit. Usually those
      'non-tech' parts are way more important than the hard skills that are can
      be learnt if needed. The main aim is to bring more 'all-around' knowlege
      to the world of people aspiring towards tech industry. ... :)
