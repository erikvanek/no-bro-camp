# Planning and sctructuring software work
This section describes how usually are software projects structured, planned and eventually executed. There are few possible frameworks that might be used for that and each of them has their pros and cons as usual. In small projects we'd like to eliminate as much bureaucracy as possible.
## Some key terminology
### Work item
A single unit of work that brings an enhancement compared to current version.
#### User story
Work item that brings immediate value to the end user. Typically it should include a phrased formed as _As a *USER X* I want *TO BE ABLE TO DO Y* so that *I HAVE SOME BENEFIT*_. The reason for this format is to have end users and focus on adding new value in mind at all times.
#### Task
Rather technical work item which does not need to bring immediate value to the user. Often this includes code and infrastructure improvements that are hidden visually from the user, but the user should benefit from them by having increased quality.
#### Bug
Bug is an error in our system. When either we internally or our users report us that something is not working as expected a bug ticket gets created.
### Backlog
Prioritized list of work items that are enhancing current functionality. Those items that have the least amount of uncertainty are placed at the top of this list. The uncertainty can be either lack of technical knowledge, unresolved dependency on other teams / features, lack of clarity of what this work item is supposed to do and many more.
