<h1>Process to product</h1>
<p>So you've got your idea. Now it's finally time to start executing it. No coding yet. Let's take a step back and think what is the main idea of that project. What is the biggest value it can add to its users. What comes first and what can follow. Our time and focus is limited and we have to choose wisely where we want to spend our energy.</p>
<h2>TL;DR;</h2>
<ul>
<li>main idea</li>
<li>break into smaller chunks</li>
<li>order / prioritize chunks</li>
<li>pick one and start and then do another one :)</li>
<li>ship when there is something to be seen</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it :)</p>
<h2>Long story long</h2>
<p>This part is purely non-technical. We'll cover how to get from a project idea to a launched site somewhere out there on the internetz. The key to a sustainable and well-paced project is to be able to identify logical <em>seams</em> in what you want to build. That helps massively.</p>
<h2>To waterfall, or not to waterfall</h2>
<p>Why talking about waterfalls in software development world? It is a historical software development paradigm that might resemble to a hardware manufacturing.</p>
<h2>Pragmatic agile all the things</h2>
<p>What does it mean to be pragmatic?
Agile shines in an ever-changing environment</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Think of your project as a Lego kit. It has a base, it has different types of pieces. Some of them fit together, some of them don't. Now forget any possible technical limitations and try to answer a simple question - &quot;What is the main deliverable of my project?&quot;. This is the most important part of this section. If don't define desired goal properly, we're not going to build what we want to.</p>
<h1>So we know what we want to do, what next?</h1>
<p>You've successfully decided what you want to be working on. That's a great first step. Enjoy that for a moment!
Now let's get a small bit of hopefully not so boring <a href="../sdlc">theory</a> that should help us to organize our project better.</p>
